I'm a Software Engineer based in South Florida.

Currently I'm interested in site reliability, monitoring, logging, and cloudy stuff like containerization. I also think networking is really cool.

Outside of work I enjoy watching sports, gaming, weight-lifting and playing basketball. I also enjoy wine, whiskey, and trying interesting food.
