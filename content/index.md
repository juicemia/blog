# About Me

I'm a Software Engineer based in South Florida.

Currently I'm interested in site reliability, monitoring, logging, cloudy stuff like containerization. I also think networking is really cool.

Outside of work I enjoy college football, gaming, working out and playing basketball. I also enjoy drinking wine and trying interesting food.
